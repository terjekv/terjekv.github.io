Hi, I'm Terje.

I write stuff, poke at stuff, and walk around stuff. To keep a track
of this myself, I have ressurected the idea of having a web page.

My day job consists of working as a systems administrator at the
University of Oslo. Here I write a fair bit of code (primarily
ansible, bash, cfengine, perl, powershell, and python) and perform
a number of other duties. The relevant
professional profile is available on
[linkedin](https://linkedin.com/terjekvernes).

In my spare time, I like to go hiking and write fiction. I have
written novels, ranging from comedy to high fantasy to psychological
crime thrillers. I have also written some poetry in my day.
I am currently in the process of seeking representation for my works.

The site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using the
[centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium) theme created
by [Ben Centra](http://bencentra.com).
