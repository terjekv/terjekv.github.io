    I wanted to get out early, but it got a bit later than expected.
    Thankfully the weather was warm but not baking. The hiking app 
    suggests it was around 17C.

  title: The path to Grønlia cabin
  text: >
    This is a well-trodden path that for most of the way follows a creek.
    It can get a bit wet following rains, and in winter you get ice.
    Today though? It was lovely.

    The cabin itself is available to be rented,
    but it is otherwise locked. It supposedly holds 30–40 people and there are two open areas
    outside for food and fun.

    Once past Grønlia cabin the climb starts. The first few minutes have a eerie beauty to them, but
    then the ascent begins. This ascent is fairly steep and again there is a fair bit of water. This
    picture is taken just after the last of the wet areas have been passed.

    Østmarka is renowned for one thing above all else. Walking in the east-west direction is nothing
    but hills. Here I am heading south, which means I will stay on this ridge pretty for another
    three or four kilometers - until Haukåsen.

    Looking back down it doesn't seem steep, and here it really isn't. In total, the difference in elevation
    from Grønlia to here is around a hundred meters. Unforuately, I start another hundred plus below Grønlia...

    There was dew everywhere on every leaf. I was the first person here today and it was already around 11am.
    Normally I would encounter maybe one or two people, and at least one pupper, by the time I reached this area.

  text: >
    I love this place. Lauvtjern is one of the primary reasons I walk the same route almost every time I head
    into the woods around here. Also, and I don't know why this is, but there are no mosquitos here.

    I ate, I drank, I even took a ten-minute snooze. I stayed for maybe fourty-five minutes and I was perfectly
    alone the entire time.

    This area is somehow also mosquito-free. Thankfully. The logs, when wet, can be a bit treacherous, so this is
    one place I try to pace myself if I'm travelling light. 

- title: The Haukåsen plateu

    Stark, flat, and usually busy. Today there was noone. Not pictured? A radar tower.

    Fault lines everywhere!

  text: >
    As Haukåsen is cleared for the radar tower, the plateu takes on a look reminescent of mountain regions
    in Norway. I'm a sucker for this look, so this is another favorite stretch of mine, even if we're only
    at 357 meters.

- title: The forest road down to Mariholtet
  src: IMG_0919.jpg
  text: >
    You could do a very long hike in Østmarka just on roads like these, and they tend to be busy. Today I met two people
    heading up to Haukåsen. This road connects to Mariholtet which is a staffed and open cafe with flusing toilets.

- title: The waterfalls by Sarabråten

  text: >
    A fair bit later I reach the waterfalls by Sarabråten. I have mostly walked the roads to get here and I finally
    encountered people These waterfalls come from the creek that fills an old reservoir up top.

    I do have a lot of pictures of this exact piece of road. I wonder why?

- title: Nøklevann seen from Sarabråten
  src: IMG_0930.jpg
  text: >
    Another favorite. This place is almost always busy. Getting a seat with a view isn't a given. There used to be a large
    estate here and it got its water from the reservoir that now feeds the waterfall.

  text: >
    A short walk from a residential area, with a parking lot right next door. Lutvann is always busy.
    Today was no different. I found a quiet spot far down the east side of the waters and got some
    space to myself. In the building heat, the soak was ever pleasant.

I like my hiking time. It's a thing of solitude that allows my mind to wander.
I either travel very light, where I carry nothing more than I wear, or I pack
a bag. Today I was planning on going light, but the weather seemed decent and
I decided to bring my backpack...

So there you have it. A lovely day in Østmarka. This route is around 22km
(around 14 US miles) long. With long breaks and a pleasant tempo, I was out
and about for around six hours. I'm so happy I decided to make a day of it.
