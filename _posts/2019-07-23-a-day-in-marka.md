Living in Oslo comes with a number of perks. The option to put on your shoes and be alone in the woods within the hour, by only walking, is one it’s hard to replace.

I had a few options today. I considered traveling light. This usually means I carry nothing more than what I have to, which translates to a phone, wallet, keys, as well as AirPods and their case. This allows for tempo, but requires stopping somewhere for food and water. Fortunately, [Mariholtet][1] is open all summer, so that kinda works.

However, it was getting warmer and my schedule was clear, so I figured I’d enjoy the outdoors a fair bit. So, I packed my bag and took my time.

And boy was it worth it.
