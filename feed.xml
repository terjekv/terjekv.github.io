        <title>A day in Østmarka</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I like my hiking time. It’s a thing of solitude that allows my mind to wander.
I either travel very light, where I carry nothing more than I wear, or I pack
a bag. Today I was planning on going light, but the weather seemed decent and
I decided to bring my backpack…&lt;/p&gt;

Thankfully the weather was warm but not baking. The hiking app  suggests it was around 17C. &quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://terje.kvernes.no/assets/gallery/hiking/2019-07-23/IMG_0827.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leaving the roads behind&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. A lovely day in Østmarka. This route is around 22km
(around 14 US miles) long. With long breaks and a pleasant tempo, I was out
and about for around six hours. I’m so happy I decided to make a day of it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ansible for fun and fright</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-why-ansible&quot;&gt;So, why Ansible?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansible has its advantages. For more ephemeral assets, I quite like its client-less design and the way it often works as a substitute for complex scripts. Ansible is also full of active development, with a rich and vibrant community that contributes code in a myriad of ways. This makes Ansible one of those tools it is so easy to reach for…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and then shoot yourself in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was one of those moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem-at-hand&quot;&gt;The problem at hand…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task was annoying. I needed to copy a directory from one node to another. They both run MacOS, so my immediate thought was simple enough. Create a temporary SSH key on the sender node, copy the public key over to the receiver, and add the key to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; of the relevant user on the receiver node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-solution-presents-itself&quot;&gt;A solution presents itself!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look through the Ansible documentation provided me with a set of tools that are designed to do a lot of this work. One can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_delegation.html#delegation&quot; title=&quot;Ansible documentation : Delegation &quot;&gt;delegate_to&lt;/a&gt; to run things on a specific node, copying is offered via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/synchronize_module.html&quot; title=&quot;Ansible documentation : The syncronize module&quot;&gt;synchronize&lt;/a&gt; module, and there is a module called &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/authorized_key_module.html&quot; title=&quot;Ansible documentation : The authorized_key module&quot;&gt;authorized_key&lt;/a&gt; that is designed to manipulate the relevant file. Joy! A solid toolbox is already on offer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution-uhm-isnt&quot;&gt;The solution, uhm, isn’t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. Or, well, not. Trying to get synchronize to use the temporary ssh key (equivalent to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rsync -e “ssh -i /path/to/key”&lt;/code&gt;) fell through. Okay. One can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt; and manually construct the rsync command. Not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/synchronize_module.html&quot;&gt;Authorized_key&lt;/a&gt; however, that module was a big deal. An undocumented feature of its use is that it parses your current file to rebuild it when you add a key. However, when doing so, it creates a dict with the keys as, well, the keys. The consequences of that (immediately obvious) design choice is that if you have a key with multiple option strings, like distinct from-statments, all but one disappear when the file is rebuilt. This specific setup exists on our MacOS machines due to a bug where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;from=“hostname&quot;&lt;/code&gt; didn’t work, but &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;from=“ipv4addr&quot;&lt;/code&gt; did. Since we dual stack, we also have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;from=“ipv6addr&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, after adding the temporary key, the file was rebuilt and then only contained the key once, with one of the from-lies. In this case, we only got the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;from=“ipv4addr”&lt;/code&gt; option for the key. This broke all future Ansible scripts as the machine in question tried to connect via IPv6, and then got told to sod off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of panic — I really didn’t want to have to physically find the machine and log into it — the situation resolved itself by adding a -4 to ssh, but, well, ouch. It also doesn’t help that one of the nodes I was testing on had a broken IPv6 route setup, so if I had run the code there, I’d have to gain physical access to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A humorous piece of irony is that the broken IPv6 configuration was performed via Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-a-solution&quot;&gt;So, a solution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. A solution. The solution to adding the ssh keys became the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/lineinfile_module.html&quot; title=&quot;Ansible documentation : Lineinfile&quot;&gt;lineinfile&lt;/a&gt; module. Cache the ssh key line and add/remove it via lineinfile. It makes no assumptions about the rest of the file, so it will work[tm].&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons in writing fiction — &amp;#35;1</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;lesson-1-kill-your-darlings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lesson #1: Kill your darlings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a number of lessons I have had to learn over the last number of years. Above them all, this one has taken me further than any other. And yes, it’s harsh. And yes, it’s not what we want to hear. But it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kill your darlings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-but-i-love-my-darlings&quot;&gt;…but, but, I love my darlings!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, well, I’m not talking about the trope of killing your characters to make your audience weep. No, those are characters. Those aren’t the darlings that need to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darlings in question are the works you have written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, I don’t think you should burn them. But you need to let them go. I didn’t. For the longest time I stuck to my first story. I labored over bits and pieces, polished until it and I bled, and sure, up until a point, the work improved. I got to write paragraphs like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no anger in her. No resentment. I push a spot so sore, so tender, so fragile in all its glory, and all she presents is the infinite sadness of promises broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-great-why-kill-that&quot;&gt;That’s great, why kill &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the return of investment fell off a cliff. I had other stories that lived eternally on the back burner. I never thought I’d get there. I figured this would be my one book. The first draft took years. Many years. How could I ever start that again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I did. I had a story. A different story. I described it to friends as a mind-cleanser. Something to take me out of the world I had written and into something else. A way to switch contexts. A way to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I did. Sure, it wasn’t a tome. It was barely sixty thousand words. But, it was different. A new start. And it took me three months. It had been years since I had produced even ten thousand new words in a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-uhm-thats-cool-i-suppose&quot;&gt;So, uhm, that’s cool, I suppose?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It was. I was no longer polishing. I was &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it felt damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did a bit of polish, and then did it again. A new project. Four more books. In a series. Totaling over four hundred thousand words. With polish. With rewrites. That took three years and eight months. And now I’m looking at what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All because I kill my darlings.&lt;/p&gt;
